### Automated application for capturing and storage job vacancies for Python developers

JobSeekerBot, an automated application built in Python that uses the Selenium library to search for and collect job vacancies specifically for Python developers from various job sites. The bot navigates web pages, extracts relevant information such as job titles and links, and stores this data in an efficient data structure. In the future, the collected data will be integrated into a database to facilitate analysis and improvements in scraping routines.
